# Pokemon-App-with-Simple-Authorization
Pokemon App with added sign up and login features
You could simply sign up and login on the same page. Upon signing up, the credentials are saved on credentials.json. The program will not allow signing up if the username already exists or if the repeated password does not match the first one. If signup was succesfull a message is displayed confirming the success. Login form is right under the sign up container, login will check whether the password was correct. If the login is succesfull the index page will direct the user to /app/username where the Pokemon app runs.

The frontend (HTML and CSS) of signup and login forms were taken as a draft from https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_signup_form.asp.
